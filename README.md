# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment


# Chatbot Integration with Database

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a robust backend system for a chatbot that processes and manages various requests related to products and suppliers. The backend system utilizes FastAPI for building the API and PostgreSQL for managing the database, ensuring efficient processing and handling of chatbot requests.

## Purpose
The main objective of this project is to create a backend system for a chatbot that can handle various requests related to products and suppliers. This setup ensures high performance and reliability.

## Key Components and Steps

### Backend Setup
- **Python Virtual Environment (`venv`)**: Used to manage and isolate project dependencies, ensuring consistency.
- **FastAPI Framework**: Built a high-performance, asynchronous API for handling chatbot requests.
- **Uvicorn Server**: Runs the FastAPI application with real-time code reloading during development.

### Database Configuration
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Configured to store and manage data about products and suppliers efficiently.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Defines and interacts with database models, representing data structure and relationships.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed securely using `dotenv` for database connection strings and other sensitive information.

### API Endpoints
- **Product and Supplier Routes**: Implemented endpoints to fetch products by brand and suppliers by category, providing structured responses in JSON format.
- **Error Handling**: Integrated robust error handling mechanisms to ensure reliable API responses and meaningful error messages.

### Data Management
- **Schema Definitions**: SQL scripts define the structure of the database tables for products and suppliers.
- **Sample Data Insertion**: Added sample data to the database for functionality testing and real-world scenario handling.

### Deployment and Testing
- **Uvicorn Deployment**: Deployed the FastAPI application on a local server for testing and validation.
- **API Documentation**: Generated interactive API documentation using Swagger UI for easy testing and exploration.

## Workflow
1. **User Request**: User sends a request to the chatbot for information about products or suppliers.
2. **API Endpoint**: The request is routed to the appropriate API endpoint in the FastAPI application.
3. **Database Query**: Endpoint queries the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy to retrieve the requested data.
4. **Response**: API formats the response in JSON and sends it back to the chatbot, providing information to the user.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Database Connection Issues**: Resolved by accurately configuring environment variables and implementing comprehensive error handling.
- **Data Integrity and Consistency**: Ensured through structured schemas, SQLAlchemy ORM, and validation checks within the application.

## Outcome
A functional and scalable backend system capable of efficiently handling chatbot requests. The system is well-documented, secure, and ready for integration with frontend applications or other services.

## Personal Contribution
Highlight specific roles and contributions in the project:
- **Design and Implementation**: Developed the API endpoints and database models.
- **Problem Solving**: Troubleshot and resolved issues related to database connections and data handling.
- **Testing and Validation**: Conducted thorough testing to ensure reliability and performance.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to integrate multiple technologies and create a cohesive system that efficiently handles chatbot requests, showcasing technical skills in backend development, database management, and API design.

Feel free to add any personal experiences or unique challenges faced during the project to make your explanation more engaging and authentic.
